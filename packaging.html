              <p>
                  This project reimagines the classic UNO card game through a Victorian
                  design lens, combining ornate typography, symmetrical layouts, and rich
                  color tones. The goal was to elevate a familiar product into a premium,
                  collectible experience while maintaining strong brand recognition. This was hand drawn and then it was illustrated in Adobe Illustrator. Attention to detail was crucial in balancing historical aesthetics with modern readability.

              <p>
                  This packaging design was made for a company called Color drift. I wanted this project to be a nice, clean and simply design. The layout highlights key features while keeping the design clean and approachable. Emphasis was
                  placed on legibility, product visibility, and balanced typography to
                  create packaging that feels both practical and polished for everyday
                  consumers.
