        <div class="detail-label">The Approach</div>
        <div class="detail-content"><p>I explored themes of deception, consequence, and loss of innocence by altering the visual tone and atmosphere of the story. The cover and interior layouts were designed to create unease through contrast, shadow, and distortion. By manipulating familiar imagery into something unsettling, the project reframes a traditional moral tale into a psychological horror experience.</p></div>

        <div class="detail-label">The story</div>
        <div class="detail-content"><p>Pinocchio lives among the villagers of a small Italian town, desperate to be accepted as one of them despite being made of wood. At first, the villagers are wary but curious about the puppet boy brought to life. Pinocchio wants nothing more than to fit in, to make friends, and to be seen as normal. But whenever he lies, his nose starts to grow no matter how small the lie is. The sharp, splintered nose becomes a danger to anyone nearby.
As strange injuries begin appearing around the village, people whisper about the wooden boy and the curse he carries. Pinocchio panics and hides the truth, telling more lies to protect himself from rejection. But each lie only makes the transformations more violent, unpredictable, and deadly. The villagers’ curiosity turns to fear, then anger. They begin to watch him closely, convinced he is the cause of the unexplained harm spreading through the town.
Pinocchio becomes trapped between two forces: the villagers who want answers, and his own growing fear that he may truly be dangerous. The more he tries to cover the truth, the more his body betrays him. Eventually, the villagers confront him, forcing Pinocchio to face the consequences of the lies he’s built his life on. As they confront him Pinocchio’s nose transforms into a weapon and kills everyone around him. He was horrified at first but even as he knew he screwed up, he realized that he didn’t need to be accepted by anyone. He realized that he was better of alone so he begins to start to kill all of the villagers until there is no one left alive
