        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Obesity is often viewed as a matter of willpower rather than a chronic medical condition. This stigma discourages patients from seeking treatment and prevents healthcare providers from initiating early intervention. As a result, action is delayed until the condition becomes more severe.

The real challenge was not just raising awareness, it was reframing the conversation from blame to medical legitimacy.</p>

        <div class="detail-label">Insight</div>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Through research and team discussion, we identified a key emotional barrier: many patients internalize stigma and believe their condition is entirely self-inflicted. This perception creates shame, avoidance, and delayed treatment.

To inspire earlier action, the campaign needed to shift the narrative from personal fault to medical empowerment.

        <div class="detail-label">Stategic Idea</div>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>Our strategy centered on repositioning obesity as a treatable medical condition, not a personal failure. By normalizing medical intervention and encouraging proactive conversations with healthcare providers, we aimed to empower patients to take action earlier.

The tone needed to feel supportive, not corrective.

        <div class="detail-label">Execution</div>
        <div class="detail-content">
          <p>To bring the idea to life, we introduced a gamified system that rewards patients for taking real, medically guided steps toward treatment such as scheduling an appointment or starting a care plan. Instead of framing treatment as something shame-driven or overwhelming, the reward structure reinforces progress and celebrates small wins.

The goal was to shift the emotional experience from avoidance to momentum. By making early action feel achievable and supported, the campaign encourages patients to engage with healthcare providers sooner.

          <p>I initially contributed as a copywriter during early concept development before transitioning into a design-focused role. I created one of the final campaign posters and produced all visual mockups used in our presentation materials.</p>

          <p>This project strengthened my understanding of how messaging can influence behavior in healthcare contexts. I learned how critical tone and framing are when addressing sensitive conditions, and how strategic clarity must guide visual execution.</p>
