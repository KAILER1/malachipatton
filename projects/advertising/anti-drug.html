        <div class="detail-label">Project Overview</div>
        <div class="detail-content">A social awareness design focused on addressing the dangers of drug use through clear, emotionally direct visual communication.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-label">Audience</div>
        <div class="detail-content"><p>Young adults and community members who struggle with drug addiction</p></div>

      <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-label">The Challenge</div>
        <div class="detail-content"><p>Communicate the risks and long-term consequences of drug use without relying on fear tactics alone. The design needed to balance emotional weight with clarity so the message would resonate instead of being ignored. Another challenege was also making the design mainly focusing on the typography</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="detail-block">
        <div class="detail-label">The Approach</div>
        <div class="detail-content"><p>I focused on creating a strong central visual that immediately communicates tension and consequence. Rather than overcrowding the design with excessive information, I allowed the imagery and headline to work together to deliver a direct and memorable message. The composition and typography were kept intentional and focused, ensuring the message remained clear and impactful at a glance.</p></div>
