          <p>
            My name is Malachi Patton, and I am a creative designer with a strong interest in advertising, marketing, photography and visual storytelling. I'm currently studying at New York City College of Technology (City Tech) in Brooklyn, where I've developed a solid foundation in design
            principles, concept development, and creative problem-solving.
          </p>

          <p>
            My work focuses on communicating clear ideas through thoughtful visuals that balance creativity with purpose. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think strategically while still pushing creative boundaries.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether I'm designing an advertisement, developing a brand concept, or capturing moments through photography, my goal is to create work that feels intentional and engaging. I'm particularly interested in how design and imagery can influence perception, evoke emotion, and connect with audiences on a deeper level.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through academic and personal projects, I've gained experience in graphic design, advertising, marketing, infographics, packaging design and hands-on photography. I value attention to detail, strong composition, and consistency across visual systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm currently seeking opportunities in advertising, marketing, and photography where I can collaborate with others, contribute meaningful ideas, and continue developing as a creative professional.
